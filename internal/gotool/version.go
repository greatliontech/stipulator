// canonical go/version.Lang after one normalization — the value
// trimmed and cut at its first space, so a trailing platform tuple
// ("go1.27.0 linux/amd64") or the newline exec's Output carries is
// dropped. Lang's own grammar reads vendor flavors, experiment
// suffixes, release candidates and the current development-build
// spelling ("go1.28-devel_abc123 …" reads as go1.28: a development
// cycle sets its release's language) as suffixes of the series, and
// whatever it rejects — the legacy "devel go1.28-…" spelling, whose
// first field is no version; a `go version` line; a string Lang's
// grammar refuses — answers "": the canonical parser's judgment is the
// contract, fail-closed, the one grammar gofresh's series judgment
// reads, exported for every consumer's floor and release-tag
// derivation (REQ-fresh-toolchain-skew).
