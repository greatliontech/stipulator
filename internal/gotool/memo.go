// environment — less PWD when a directory is named, since the policy
// derives PWD from it and the coordinate already collapses the
// directory's spellings; with no directory named the command runs in
// the process's own, which the go command reads through $PWD (a
// symlinked spelling walks a different parent chain to the module
// files), so PWD stays in the key — joined by NUL. Two spellings of
// one directory and two orderings of one environment key alike; any
// other setting moves the key; a malformed environment is refused
// rather than keyed raw.
