// Package resident reads a process's resident set: its resident and peak
// resident bytes, and its live descendants — the children a consumer
// spawns (package test binaries, go drivers, a resolver child) and
// theirs — as their count, their summed resident bytes, the largest
// single descendant's own peak, and each direct child's tree; beside it
// the host's memory and the soft ceiling a consumer installs from it.
// It is the fleet's one home for the resident datum every consumer
// states on its progress face (REQ-mcp-progress): a reading
// the host answers, on Linux through /proc; a host that does not
// answer, or a /proc that cannot be listed, yields no sample, and the
// datum is absent rather than zero. A reading walks the whole process
// table once; a consumer takes it at phase transitions and endings, so
// its cost is bounded by those.
